# Alexandra - React Epub library
---
> Alexandra is an Epuplibrary using NestJS as Backend, MongoDB as DataBase and React with Chakra UI as Frontend. 

This is first and foremost an Personal Project of my own. But I'am in need of help in some Areas like The Epup - migration function.

## Installation 

First clone the Repo and run the Docker-compose.yml with 
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml

then start the Backend with yarn nest start
and the frontend with yarn vite
place all .epub files in /backend/uploads/archiv and navigate to http://localhost:3000/books/test to Migrate The Database

navigate your webrowser to http://localhost:5173 and you should be good to go.
